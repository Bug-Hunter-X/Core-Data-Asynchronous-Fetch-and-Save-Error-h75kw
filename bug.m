In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and asynchronous operations.  Consider this scenario: You fetch data from a Core Data stack in a background thread, modify the fetched objects, and then attempt to save the context on the main thread.  The problem? The context you're trying to save might no longer be the same as the one used for fetching.  This is often because the fetched objects have become detached from the context, leading to an error during the save operation.  The error message itself might be ambiguous, hinting at a constraint violation or other general save failures.  The root cause is actually the detached objects.
