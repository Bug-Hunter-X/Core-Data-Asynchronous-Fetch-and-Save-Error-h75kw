To fix this, ensure that the context used for saving is the same context that fetched the objects or that the objects are properly managed during the asynchronous process. One approach is to pass the same `NSManagedObjectContext` to both the background fetch operation and the main thread save operation, creating a single, persistent context and using proper synchronization techniques to avoid race conditions.

Another more modern approach is to use `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` which handles concurrency.  This simplifies the process, as the container automatically manages the contexts across threads.  If you are dealing with a large amount of data or complex concurrency scenarios, using `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` is highly recommended.

Here's an example of using the same context:

```objectivec
NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext = [[self persistentContainer] viewContext];

dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_BACKGROUND, 0), ^{ 
    // Perform your fetch operation using managedObjectContext here
    // ...
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        NSError *error = nil; 
        if (![managedObjectContext save:&error]) { 
            //Handle the error
        }
    });
});
```
